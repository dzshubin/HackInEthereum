#HackInEthereum

## Goal
There are a collection of my tools. They are very simple, very preliminary tools (maybe including some mistakes) for helping me to learn Ethereum, to understand it better.


## modules

### keyGenerator
 To generate Ethereum address as you wish

### nodeSpider
A web spider to crawl a list of the full node in the [ethernodes.org](https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1)
